# ðŸ§  Smart Heart Analyzer â€“ Supervised Learning Model
Smart Health Analyzer is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on clinical features. This predictive model is built using supervised learning techniques on a labeled dataset (heart.csv) sourced from Kaggle.
The project employs two widely used classification algorithms:

    a)Logistic Regression
    b)Naive Bayes Classification
