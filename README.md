# ðŸ§  Smart Heart Analyzer â€“ Supervised Learning Model
Smart Health Analyzer is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on clinical features. This predictive model is built using supervised learning techniques on a labeled dataset (heart.csv) sourced from Kaggle.
The project employs two widely used classification algorithms:

    a)Logistic Regression
    b)Naive Bayes Classification

## ðŸ§  Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Supervised Learning Model

This project is a **Supervised Machine Learning** application that predicts whether a passenger survived the **Titanic disaster**, using a labeled dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

In this project, we implemented two popular classification algorithms:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Random Forest Classifier**

The pipeline includes **feature engineering**, **data preprocessing**, and **model evaluation**. Both models are trained and validated, and their performance is compared using cross-validation and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score).
The model with the **best overall performance** is selected and used for final predictions.
